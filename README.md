The purpose of this project was to achieve two goals:

1)

Learn ASP.NET Core and put into practice and expand on some of the principles I had learnt from training videos.

2)

Create a programmatic solution to a spreadsheet I had been using for several years to catalogue the prices for various vintage items sold on eBay.  A programmatic solution would not offer me a quick solution to the problem but It would provide me the opportunity to add in more powerful features and a nicer user interface.

Technologies / Principles Used:

- C#
- JavaScript
- ASP.NET MVC Core
- CSS / Bootstrap Themes & Icons
- Entity Framework - Code first approach
- SQL Server Express backend database
- TDD (Microsoft Test Framework + Fluent Assertion)
