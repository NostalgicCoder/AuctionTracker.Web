9th April 2024:

The purpose of this project was to achieve two goals:

Learn ASP.NET Core and put into practice and expand on some of the principles I had learnt from training videos.

Create a programmatic solution to a spreadsheet I had been using for several years to catalogue the prices for various vintage items sold on eBay. A programmatic solution would not offer me a quick solution to the problem but It would provide me the opportunity to add in more powerful features and a nicer user interface.
