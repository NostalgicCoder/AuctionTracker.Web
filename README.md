eBay Auction Tracker - About:
-----------------------------------------

The purpose of this project was to achieve two goals:

1)

Learn ASP.NET Core and put into practice and expand on some of the principles I had learnt from training videos.

2)

Create a programmatic solution to a spreadsheet I had been using for several years to catalogue the prices for various vintage items sold on eBay.  A programmatic solution would not offer me a quick solution to the problem but It would provide me the opportunity to add in more powerful features and a nicer user interface.

Technologies / Principles Used:

- C#
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- ASP.NET MVC Core
- CSS / Bootstrap Themes & Icons
- Chart.js
- REST
- IGDB API (Via my own wrapper, project 'IgdbApi.Lib')
- RestSharp
- Newtonsoft.Json
- Entity Framework - Code first approach
- SQL Server Express backend database
- TDD (Microsoft Test Framework + Fluent Assertion)

Requirements:

- SQL backend database to be installed, refer to '\Resources\AuctionDb.bak'
- Signup to 'Twitch developer portal' to aquire 'clientId' and 'clientSecret' to use the IGDB API functionality in this program, refer to https://api-docs.igdb.com/#authentication
